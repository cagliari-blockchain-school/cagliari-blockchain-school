# 5th Scientific School on Blockchain & Distributed Ledger Technologies

**Cagliari (Italy), September 10-13, 2024**

Crypto economics is a new discipline born after the rise of virtual currencies and distributed ledger technologies, and is rapidly developing in a unique intersection between computing, cryptography,  law,
economics, and game theory. The school aims at disseminating  knowledge about the foundations and the applications of these technologies to researchers, PhD students, scholars and technologists in industry and academia, not excluding under- or new graduates with strong technical drive and a sufficient background.


## Important dates

- Application deadline: July 15, 2024
- Notification: July 19, 2024
- School dates: **September 10-13, 2024**


## Venue & accommodation

The school, which is planned as a physical, in-person event, will be hosted at the [Department of Mathematics and Computer Science](https://goo.gl/maps/jjzgXGtSLtVBSrDu9) of the University of Cagliari (Italy).

The venue is in the city center, close to the historical area of Castello. 
The city center can be reached from the [Cagliari airport](http://www.sogaer.it/it) in 15' by taxi (it costs around 20 EUR), or by train.

In the center of Cagliari there are several affordable accommodation opportunities: check [bed-and-breakfast.it](https://www.bed-and-breakfast.it/lista_strutture_ur.cfm?locale=it&zona=Castello&citta=Cagliari&idregione=14) and

## Registration & selection

The school plans for a maximum of 20 attendees; the attendance to the school is **free**, while travel and accommodation expenses are to be paid by participants (there are several affordable accommodations in Cagliari). 
The participants will be selected by the scientific  committee on a CV best-match basis.
All sessions will be held in English.

## Lectures

<details>
<summary><b>Smart contract languages: an overview</b></summary>
Decentralized blockchain platforms support the secure exchange of assets among users without relying on trusted third parties. These exchanges are programmed with smart contracts, computer programs directly executed by blockchain nodes. 
Multiple smart contract languages are available nowadays to developers, each with its own distinctive features, strengths, and weaknesses. In this lecture, we examine the smart contract languages used in six major blockchain platforms: Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, Algorand, Aptos, and Tezos. Starting with a high-level overview of their design choices, we discuss their programming style, security, code readability, and usability.

**Solidity vs. Move side-by-side**

Andrea Pinna, University of Cagliari (IT)
Alvise Spanò, Ca' Foscari University of Venice (IT)


**Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Protocols and their Compositions**

Pietro Saggese, IMT Lucca (IT)


**Securing Ethereum contracts: techniques and tools**

Dalila Ressi, Ca' Foscari University of Venice (IT)

<details>
<summary><b>Preventing DeFi Bugs with Formal Verification</b></summary>
Join us for an engaging workshop on the Certora Prover, a cutting-edge formal verification tool designed to uncover bugs in DeFi smart contracts. We will begin with a brief lecture introducing the fundamentals of formal verification, its underlying principles, and its unique advantages. The primary focus of the workshop will be a hands-on exercise, where participants will learn to write specifications in CVL, the Certora Verification Language. The participants will test smart contract code against their specification using the Certora Prover. This session is ideal for those looking to deepen their understanding of formal verification and smart contract security.

<summary><b>IOTA Smart Contracts</b></summary>
The IOTA DLT supports the execution of Move smart contracts on the Layer 1. In particular, the IOTA smart contract platform supports the Sui Move flavour. In this flavour the concept of Object is central, that is, the ledger is composed of a series of Objects defined by Move structs and indexed by a key. This allows to have so called ‘owned objects’, that behaves similarly to UTXOs, and shared objects, that behaves similarly to shared accounts. The Object-based ledger, thus, mixes the benefits of a UTXO-based model and a Account-based model.

## Hackathon & Awards

Besides the lectures and lab sessions, the school will feature an hackathon on IOTA smart contracts. Participants will be grouped by the school organizers according to their background and expertise. The groups, composed of 3 students each, will start their projects during the last two days of the school. Projects can be completed offline after the school ends.

Projects will be evaluated by the school organizers and the IOTA Foundation. 
The best three projects will receive an award in IOTA cryptocurrency.
The amounts of the awards are the following:
- **1st prize** (2500 EUR)
- **2nd prize** (1500 EUR)
- **3rd prize** (1000 EUR)
